# Learning-Footstep-Planner-CNN

This project contains the code for the paper "Learning-based Foot-Shape-Aware Foothold Selection for Quadrupedal Robots" - in particular, it contains the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for footstep planning. It includes scripts for defining the CNN model, training the model, and a saved checkpoint for the model.
